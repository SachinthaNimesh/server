# ADHD Support App

> A React Native mobile application designed to help people with ADHD manage sensory overload and forgetfulness using AI-powered assistance and ambient sound therapy.

## 🎯 Overview

This app provides two core features:

1. **LostToFound** - AI-powered memory assistant that helps you remember where you placed items
2. **SoundSanctuary** - Noise-calming system that plays soothing sounds when ambient noise exceeds your comfort threshold

## ✨ Key Features

### LostToFound (Memory Assistant)

- 🎤 **Voice & Text Input**: Record where you place items using natural language
- 🤖 **AI Processing**: Uses LLM (OpenAI, Gemini, or Hugging Face) to understand and extract information
- 📍 **Location Tracking**: Automatically captures GPS coordinates
- 💬 **Conversational Queries**: Ask "Where are my keys?" in natural language
- 🗺️ **Google Maps Integration**: Navigate to stored item locations
- 💾 **Persistent Storage**: Rolling history of last 30 items (configurable)
- 🔄 **Context-Aware**: Maintains conversation context for intelligent follow-ups

### SoundSanctuary (Noise Calming)

- 🎧 **Ambient Noise Monitoring**: Periodically checks environmental noise levels
- 🔊 **Automatic Playback**: Plays soothing sounds when threshold is exceeded
- 🌊 **Multiple Sound Options**: Rain, ocean waves, forest, white noise
- 🎚️ **Volume Control**: Adjustable playback volume
- 🔋 **Battery Efficient**: 5-second check intervals instead of continuous monitoring
- ⚙️ **Customizable Threshold**: Set your personal noise tolerance level

### Smart Priority Management

- ⏸️ **Auto-Pause**: Pause sounds during voice commands
- 🔉 **Duck Volume**: Lower volume during voice input
- 🚫 **Ignore Mode**: Continue playback normally
- ⚙️ **Configurable**: Choose your preferred behavior in settings

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 16+
- npm or yarn
- Expo Go app on your phone
- LLM API key (OpenAI, Gemini, or Hugging Face)

### Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Copy environment template
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env and add your API key
# Choose one provider: OpenAI, Gemini, or Hugging Face

# Start the app
npm start

```

### One-Command Setup (with sample API key)

```bash
# Install and start with demo mode
npm install && echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=demo\nLLM_PROVIDER=openai" > .env && npm start
```

*Note: Demo mode will use local fallback search instead of AI*

## 📝 Usage Examples

### Storing Items

```
User: "I'm leaving my car keys on the kitchen table"
App: "Got it! I've remembered that your car keys are at kitchen table."
```

```
User: "My wallet is in the bedroom drawer"
App: "Got it! I've remembered that your wallet is at bedroom drawer."
```

### Querying Items

```
User: "Where are my car keys?"
App: "Your car keys are at kitchen table (stored on 1/15/2024, 10:30 AM)"
```

```
User: "Where did I put my wallet?"
App: "Your wallet is at bedroom drawer (stored on 1/15/2024, 10:45 AM)"
```

## 🧪 Testing

Run through the comprehensive testing checklist:

```bash
# See TESTING.md for complete test cases
# Quick smoke test:
1. Launch app
2. Store 3 items in LostToFound
3. Query for one of them
4. Go to SoundSanctuary
5. Play a sound
6. Check Settings
```

## 🔐 Permissions

The app requires:

- **Microphone**: For voice commands and noise monitoring
- **Location**: To remember where items were placed
- **Storage**: To save memories and settings locally

All permissions are requested with clear explanations and can be denied. The app provides text-based fallbacks when voice features are unavailable.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### LLM Not Working
- Check API key is valid
- Verify internet connection
- Check API quota/credits
- App will fallback to local search

### No Audio Playback
- Ensure device volume is up
- Check that sound files exist in assets/sounds/
- Grant microphone permission
- Restart app

### Location Not Saving
- Grant location permission
- Enable location services
- Check GPS signal

### App Crashes
- Clear Expo cache: `expo start -c`
- Reinstall dependencies: `rm -rf node_modules && npm install`
- Check console for errors
