## Feature Adaptations

### LostToFound on Wearable

#### Voice-First Interaction
```
User: [Presses button]
Watch: [Vibrates, shows listening indicator]
User: "Remember, my keys are on the kitchen table"
Watch: [Vibrates confirmation]
Watch Display: "✓ Keys → Kitchen"
```

**Implementation Changes:**
1. Replace visual UI with voice commands
2. Add haptic feedback for confirmations
3. Implement wake word detection ("Hey [App Name]")
4. Use edge ML for faster voice recognition
5. Display minimal visual feedback on small screen

#### Simplified Querying
```
User: [Presses button]
User: "Where are my keys?"
Watch: [Vibrates]
Watch: [Speaks] "Your keys are on the kitchen table"
Watch Display: "Kitchen Table"
          [Navigate] button
```

**Implementation Changes:**
1. Text-to-speech for responses (already implemented)
2. Quick action buttons (Navigate, Repeat)
3. Scrollable list view for multiple results
4. Complications for quick access

### SoundSanctuary on Wearable

#### Always-On Monitoring
```
Watch monitors ambient noise continuously
├── Noise > Threshold → Play calming sound via earbuds
├── Haptic pattern alert option
└── Display noise level as complication
```

**Implementation Changes:**
1. Optimize for continuous background monitoring
2. Stream audio to paired Bluetooth earbuds
3. Use efficient battery management
4. Add haptic patterns as alternative to sound

## Technical Implementation Details

### Voice Recognition on Wearable

**Option 1: On-Device (Offline)**
```javascript
// Use TensorFlow Lite or similar
import VoiceProcessor from 'edge-ml-voice';

const processor = new VoiceProcessor({
  modelPath: '/models/voice-recognition-lite.tflite',
  wakeWord: 'hey adhd helper',
  commands: ['remember', 'where is', 'find my']
});

processor.on('wakeword', () => {
  // Start listening
  hapticFeedback.single();
});

processor.on('command', (text) => {
  // Process command
  handleVoiceCommand(text);
});
```

**Option 2: Cloud Processing**
```javascript
// Stream audio to backend
const audioStream = await microphone.startStream();
const result = await cloudAPI.processVoice(audioStream);
```

### Haptic Feedback Patterns

```javascript
const HapticPatterns = {
  confirmation: [50, 100, 50],      // Short vibration
  alert: [100, 200, 100, 200, 100], // Double pulse
  error: [200],                      // Long vibration
  thresholdExceeded: [50, 50, 50, 50, 50], // Rapid pulses
};

function triggerHaptic(pattern) {
  pattern.forEach((duration, index) => {
    if (index % 2 === 0) {
      setTimeout(() => vibrationMotor.on(duration), 
                 pattern.slice(0, index).reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0));
    }
  });
}
```

### Power Management

```javascript
const PowerManager = {
  modes: {
    active: {
      screenBrightness: 100,
      monitoringInterval: 5000,
      wifiEnabled: true,
    },
    powersave: {
      screenBrightness: 30,
      monitoringInterval: 30000,
      wifiEnabled: false,
    },
    sleep: {
      screenBrightness: 0,
      monitoringInterval: null,
      wifiEnabled: false,
    }
  },
  
  autoAdjust(batteryLevel) {
    if (batteryLevel < 20) {
      this.setMode('powersave');
    } else if (batteryLevel < 10) {
      this.setMode('sleep');
    }
  }
};
```

### Data Sync Strategy

```javascript
// Two-way sync between watch and phone
const SyncManager = {
  async syncToPhone() {
    const unsyncedMemories = await db.getUnsynced();
    await bluetooth.send('memories:update', unsyncedMemories);
  },
  
  async syncFromPhone() {
    const phoneMemories = await bluetooth.request('memories:all');
    await db.merge(phoneMemories);
  },
  
  // Periodic sync every 5 minutes
  startAutoSync() {
    setInterval(() => {
      if (bluetooth.isConnected()) {
        this.syncToPhone();
        this.syncFromPhone();
      }
    }, 300000);
  }
};
```

## User Experience Considerations

### Gesture Controls

| Gesture | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Single press | Start voice command |
| Double press | Query last stored item |
| Long press | Toggle sound sanctuary |
| Swipe up | View recent memories |
| Swipe down | Open settings |
| Shake | Emergency alert |

### Visual Design for Small Screens

**Principles:**
- Large, readable text (minimum 14pt)
- High contrast colors
- Glanceable information
- Minimal scrolling
- Clear visual hierarchy

**Example Watch Face:**
```
┌─────────────────┐
│   12:45         │  ← Time
│                 │
│  🔊 65 dB       │  ← Noise level
│  📍 3 items     │  ← Memory count
│                 │
│  [🎤] [⚙️]      │  ← Quick actions
└─────────────────┘
```

### Complications (Watch Face Widgets)

- **Noise Level**: Real-time ambient noise display
- **Item Count**: Number of stored memories
- **Last Item**: Quick view of most recent memory
- **Quick Record**: Tap to start voice input

- Zero-knowledge architecture
- GDPR/HIPAA compliance
- Data deletion controls

### Voice Processing
- On-device processing preferred
- Clear audio recording indicators
- User control over data sharing
- Automatic audio deletion after processing
